                    <h4>Aaron's Story</h4>

                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron was diagnosed with Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency at
                        around 5 months old. For ease, lets refer to it as DPD. To our knowledge Aaron is currently the
                        oldest example of severe infancy born DPD living at the moment. There are less than 25 cases of
                        it reported world wide…ever.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">As a result of Aaron’s DPD diagnosis, he suffers from seizures aka
                        Epilepsy. He is on a remarkable regimen of anti-seizure meds that have not completely managed
                        his epilepsy, but has certainly made his life much more manageable. He experiences a variety of
                        neurological events daily.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron is fed through a G-tube which pumps his food directly into his
                        stomach with the help of a pump. We also deliver his meds through the G-tube. No yucky medicine
                        tastes for our boy! He has a combination of his 12 meds delivered three times a day in
                        different doses and quantities daily. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron is non-ambulatory. That means he is confined to a wheel chair. He
                        is braced from his neck to his feet because of the tone of his body and has a metal rod in his
                        back to manage his scoliosis and his pulmonary capacity.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron is non-verbal. That means he cannot communicate. He cannot do
                        this for a variety of reasons. He has a damaged, small brain which people refer to as globally
                        delayed. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron is almost blind. He cannot see as a result of cortical vision
                        impairment probably caused by the lack of brain development and the seizure activity he has
                        experienced through out his life. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron’s hearing is GREAT! He’s got that going for him and if you talk
                        or sing to him or play music for him his smile will light up a room. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron requires 24 hour care. When he is not home with his mom, dad, and
                        big brother he is with his fabulous nurse at school. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron’s prognosis was that we would be lucky if he made it to age 3.
                        That is when we started celebrating his birthday with family and friends annually. We realize
                        every day is a gift. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">As Aaron gets older his body gets weaker. When Aaron gets sick things
                        go upside down very quickly. Every hospitalization is critical because it is harder and harder
                        for him to come back from any kind distress. His autoimmune system is impaired, his respiratory
                        system is impaired, his musculoskeletal system is impaired, his global development is impaired.
                        He’s a medically complicated and fragile little guy.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">But boy, oh boy, is he handsome!</p>
