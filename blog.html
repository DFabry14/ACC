                            <h7>Carolyn Koppel - January 2021</h7>

                            <p class="left-align light">I turned 55 this year. My birthday is in January, in the
                                Midwest. I often associate it with ice and snow storms. It’s never been the most fun. We
                                used to drive to Chicago for my birthday dinner or lunch and I can’t tell you how many
                                times that plan needed to change. For my sweet sixteen birthday party a portion of my
                                guest list got stuck in a snow storm at a religious retreat in the Northwoods unable to
                                get back and enjoy my Kermit the Frog birthday cake. I am, and always will be, a Rainbow
                                Connection fan. </p>
                            <p class="left-align light">As a child, my mom would plan great parties, but never too close
                                to my birthday because people were on vacation. Presents came on Hanukah and were often
                                my “Hanukah/Birthday” gift. Two for one, as it were. As an adult, I realize why I make a
                                big deal out of 8 presents for the holiday and a separate one for a birthday. My eldest
                                son’s birthday is in the middle of December, he is in the same boat. </p>
                            <p class="left-align light">People would come back from their holidays and everyone would
                                talk about what they had done on their vacations, and my birthday, on the cusp of
                                return, was a mere flash of memory. Sometimes people would just forget. Busy time.</p>
                            <p class="left-align light">It has taken me a long time to come to learn how to enjoy my
                                birthday.</p>
                            <p class="left-align light">My son, Aaron, was born 15 years ago. He is considered
                                chronically ill and medically complex. We were told he would not live past 3 years of
                                age. When he hit that 3rd year we had a big party. Until this pandemic season we
                                continued to have one every year. We invite family, friends, doctors and therapists,
                                teachers and nurses. A thank-you to our “village” that has helped us make it to 5, then
                                10, then 15 years. Every year I say to Aaron, “Ok, one more year.” This is my wish every
                                year. We have been lucky. He listens to his mother. </p>
                            <p class="left-align light">Over the years, this idea of one more year, every year, has
                                helped me appreciate my own turn around the sun. It has helped me spin my winter
                                doldrums into hopeful wishes. Aaron is always teaching me things: this is his most
                                wonderful gift. He teaches others just by being in this world. He gives and gives and
                                gives, love and knowledge and wisdom just because he exists. This is the super power of
                                my child.</p>
                            <p class="left-align light">Our family is guaranteed nothing. None of us are. But for me, I
                                think about the day I won’t have the opportunity to say those few words to my child ,
                                “Ok, just one more year.” The year he doesn’t listen to his mother, the year that will
                                be. Aaron is not long for this world. It is hard to accept the clarity of the statement.
                                It is a reality on which our family does not dwell. This year, the pandemic has so often
                                reminded us of this truth. </p>
                            <p class="left-align light">This year I have gone out of my way to make sure people enjoy
                                their birthday with a call, a text, or a FB post. I don’t think I would have ever
                                appreciated social media as much as I do, this year, on my birthday. To be thought of,
                                if only for those few letters, HBD, on so many posts. I am so lucky. For those of us
                                that will be lucky to celebrate a birthday this year, let’s just ask for another and
                                hope we listen to ourselves. Cheers to a great year ahead. </p>
                            <p class="left-align light">Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Be kind.</p>
