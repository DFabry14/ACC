                    <h4 class="left-align">Press Release:</h4>
                    <p class="left-align light">January 1, 2019</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Local mom raises over $24,000 to bring free, fresh, coffee to families
                        and caregivers of patients admitted to the 16th floor Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at
                        Ann & Robert Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">In fewer than 6 months, the Kobb family has raised over $24,000, $6000
                        beyond their original goal of $18,000 as a living legacy, honoring their son, Aaron.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">A long, late night hospital stay with Aaron inspired her to write a
                        letter to the CEO of Keurig to find out if they could work together to make coffee more
                        accessible for families and caregivers at the hospital.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Keurig said yes and Monday, November 19, 2018, they brewed the
                        ceremonial first cup of coffee in the PICU Family Great Room at Lurie Children’s Hospital.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Proximity is key! No one wants to miss a doctor drop-in for an early
                        morning progress check. Or, maybe there are concerns about the often unpredictable timing of
                        daily rounds. Or, worst case scenario, your child just isn't doing very well.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Whether you find yourself in the PICU for the first time or the
                        fifteenth time it is a high stress environment. Aaron’s Coffee Corner provides a little peace
                        of mind and a sense of security and comfort by making sure there is access to a fresh cup of
                        coffee just steps away.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">From experience, the Kobb family knows Aaron’s Coffee Corner will
                        directly impact families. That cup of coffee also provides a sense of comfort and familiarity
                        in a far too unfamiliar place. This small gesture of making a cup of coffee accessible 24/7
                        will go a long way in acknowledging the commitment, tenacity, courage and strength of parents,
                        family and caregivers.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">A simple cup of coffee can accomplish a lot.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">The Kobb family’s goal is to remind these parents and caregivers that
                        their knowledge and experience is understood and appreciated by all the parents that have sat
                        in those rooms before them.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">ABOUT THE FAMILY:</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">The Kobb family has spent a lot of time on the 16th floor. Aaron, born
                        with a rare genetic, metabolic disorder called Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency has
                        been diagnosed, cared for, and monitored by the doctors and staff of Lurie’s Children’s
                        Hospital since he was 18 weeks old. His prognosis was that he would not live past three years
                        of age but, this year, the family gratefully celebrated Aaron’s 13th birthday.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Aaron is a medically fragile young man that is globally delayed. He
                        does not communicate, is confined to a wheel chair, requires 24 hour care, is fed through a
                        tube, suffers from epilepsy, and has a depressed respiratory and immune system. That being
                        said, he is a light that shines bright among his family, friends, and his community. He has
                        taught people to appreciate what they have and more importantly taught the young and old how to
                        be better people out in the world, to be kind.</p>
